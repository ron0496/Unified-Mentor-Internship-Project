# Project 1: Supply Chain Management Dashboard

### About Project:
Supply chain analytics is a valuable part of data-driven decision-making in various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. It is the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting data related to the movement of products and services from suppliers to customers. The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive Supply Chain Management (SCM) Dashboard using Tableau. This dashboard will help monitor and optimize various aspects of the supply chain, including inventory levels, order fulfillment, supplier performance, transportation efficiency, and overall supply chain costs.

### Below are all the features in the dataset:

● Product Type ● SKU ● Price ● Availability ● Number of products sold ● Revenue generated ● Customer demographics ● Stock levels ● Lead times ● Order quantities ● Shipping times ● Shipping carriers ● Shipping costs ● Supplier name ● Location ● Lead time ● Production volumes ● Manufacturing lead time ● Manufacturing costs ● Inspection results ● Defect rates ● Transportation modes ● Routes ● Costs
